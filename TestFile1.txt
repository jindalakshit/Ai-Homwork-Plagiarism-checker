Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data. It allows computers to improve their performance on tasks through experience.

In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data. This means that each training example is paired with an output label.

Common applications of machine learning include recommendation systems, speech recognition, and image classification.
