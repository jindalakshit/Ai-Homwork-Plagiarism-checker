Artificial intelligence includes a field called machine learning, which helps systems learn and make decisions from data. This technique enhances a computer's ability to perform tasks using experience.

One popular approach is supervised learning, where the model is trained with examples that include both input and correct output.

Machine learning is often used in areas like image recognition, voice assistants, and personalized recommendations.
